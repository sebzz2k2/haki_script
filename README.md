# hakiScript Checklist

This is a checklist for the development of the hakiScript compiler. A language inspired from javascript written in rust.

## Getting Started

- [x] Set up a project repository and version control system.

## Lexer and Parser

- [ ] Implement a lexer to tokenize the source code.
- [ ] Create a parser to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Semantic Analysis

- [ ] Develop semantic analysis to check for type compatibility and scope rules.
- [ ] Create a symbol table to manage variables, functions, and scope.

## Intermediate Representation

- [ ] Generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the code.
- [ ] Implement optimization passes to improve code quality.

## Code Generation

- [ ] Develop code generation to produce machine code, assembly, or bytecode from the IR.
- [ ] Handle runtime support, if necessary.

## Testing

- [ ] Write comprehensive test cases to ensure the compiler's correctness.
- [ ] Create tests for edge cases and expected error handling.

## Documentation

- [ ] Document the usage of your compiler.
- [ ] Provide information about language syntax and specific features.

## User-Friendly Features

- [ ] Enhance the compiler with user-friendly features like error messages and warnings.

## Packaging and Distribution

- [ ] Prepare your compiler for distribution, create installers, or package it for different platforms.

## License

- [ ] Choose and add an appropriate open-source license to your project.
